Basic Requirements for Hash Function. The purpose of a hash function is to produce a fingerprint of a File or Message or other block of data. To be useful for message authentication a hash function H must have the following properties. H can be applied to a block of data of any size. H always produces a fixed length output. Hash of message M is relatively easy to compute for any given M. This makes both hardware and software implementations practical. For any given hash code H it is computationally infeasible to find M.  A hash function with this property is referred to as one way or preimage resistant.

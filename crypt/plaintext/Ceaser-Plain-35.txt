Digital Signature Standard. The National Institute of Standards and Technology NIST published this originally as FIPS PUB one eighty six. The DSS makes use of SHA one and presents a new digital signature technique the Digital Signature Algorithm DSA. The DSS was originally proposed in Nineteen Ninety one and revised later in response to public feedback concerning the security of the scheme. There were further revisions in subsequent years and most recently in Two Thousand Thirteen as FIPS PUB one eighty six dash four. The DSS is designed to provide only the digital signature function and cannot be used for encryption or key exchange.

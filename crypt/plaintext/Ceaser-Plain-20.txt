A hash function that satisfies the first five properties in the list is referred to as a weak hash function. If the sixth property is also satisfied then it is referred to as a strong hash function. A strong hash function protects against an attack in which one party generates a message for another party to sign. For example suppose Alice agrees to sign an IOU for a small amount with Bob. Suppose Bob can find two messages with the same hash value. First one requires Alice to pay the small amount and second one requires a large payment. Alice signs the first message and Bob claims that the second message is authentic.

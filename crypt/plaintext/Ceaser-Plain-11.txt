When we do not encrypt the message then confidentiality is not provided. As mentioned message encryption by itself does not imply authentication. However it is possible to combine authentication and confidentiality in a single algorithm by encrypting a message plus its authentication tag. Typically however message authentication is provided as a separate function from message encryption. Literature suggests three situations in which message authentication without confidentiality is preferable. One example is when a message is broadcasted to many destinations. Othe example would be when encrytion is too compute intensive.

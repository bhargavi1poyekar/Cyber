Message Authentication Using a Message Authentication Code works as follows. The receiver is assured that the message has not been altered. If an attacker alters the message but does not alter the code then the receivers calculation of the code will differ from the received code. Because the attacker is assumed not to know the secret key the attacker cannot alter the code to correspond to the alterations in the message. The receiver is assured that the message is from the alleged sender. Because no one else knows the secret key no one else could prepare a message with a proper code. Further it can include a sequence number.

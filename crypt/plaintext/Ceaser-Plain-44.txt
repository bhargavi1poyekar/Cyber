Another application in which public key encryption is used to protect a symmetric key is the digital envelope which can be used to protect a message without needing to first arrange for sender and receiver to have the same secret key. The technique is referred to as a digital envelope which is the equivalent of a sealed envelope containing an unsigned letter. The general approach works as follows. Suppose Bob wishes to send a confidential message to Alice but they do not share a symmetric secret key. Bob does the following. Prepare a message. Generate a random symmetric key that will be used this one time only.

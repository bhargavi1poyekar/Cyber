There is more to a brute force attack than simply running through all possible keys. Unless known plaintext is provided the analyst must be able to recognize plaintext as plaintext. If the message is just plain text in English then the result pops out easily although the task of recognizing English would have to be automated rather than manual recognition. If the text message has been compressed before encryption then recognition becomes more difficult. And if the message is some more general type of data such as a numerical file and this has been compressed then the problem becomes even more difficult to automate.

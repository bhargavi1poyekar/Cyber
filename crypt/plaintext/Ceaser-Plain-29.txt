The scheme of private key encryption is directed toward providing authentication and or data integrity. If a user is able to successfully recover the plaintext from Bobs ciphertext using Bobs public key this indicates only Bob could have encrypted the plaintext thus providing authentication. Further no one but Bob would be able to modify the plaintext because only Bob could encrypt the plaintext with Bobs private key. Once again, the actual provision of authentication or data integrity depends on a variety of factors. This issue will be addressed later but other references are made to it where appropriate in this text.

Applications for Public-Key Cryptosystems. Public key systems are characterized by the use of a cryptographic type of algorithm with two keys. one key is held private and one key is made available publicly. Depending on the application under consideration the sender uses either the private key of the sender or the public key of the receiver. It can do both to perform some type of cryptographic function. In broad terms we can classify the use of public key cryptosystems into three categories. First one is digital signature. Second one symmetric key distribution and third one encryption of secret keys.

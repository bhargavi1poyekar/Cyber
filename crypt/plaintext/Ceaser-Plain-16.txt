Unlike the MAC, a hash function does not take a secret key as input. It illustrates three ways in which the message can be authenticated using a hash function. The message digest can be encrypted using symmetric encryption. If it is assumed that only the sender and receiver share the encryption key then authenticity is assured. The message digest can also be encrypted using public key encryption. This is explained in Section two.three. The public key approach has two advantages. It provides a digital signature as well as message authentication and it does not require the distribution of keys to communicating parties.

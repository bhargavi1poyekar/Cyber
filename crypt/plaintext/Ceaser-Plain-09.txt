A message or a file or a document or some other collection of data is said to be authentic when it is genuine and came from its alleged source. Message or data authentication is a procedure that allows communicating parties to verify that received or stored messages are authentic i.e. came from original source. The two important aspects are to verify that the contents of the message have not been altered and that the source is authentic. We may also wish to verify timeliness of a message and sequence relative to other messages flowing between two parties. All of these concerns come under the category of data integrity.

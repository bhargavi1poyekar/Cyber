Misconception about public key encryption. Because of the computational overhead of current public key encryption schemes there seems no foreseeable likelihood that symmetric encryption will be abandoned. Finally there is a feeling that key distribution is trivial when using public key encryption compared to the rather cumbersome handshaking involved with key distribution centers for symmetric encryption. For public key key distribution, some form of protocol is needed which often involves a central agent and the procedures involved are no simpler or any more efficient than those required for symmetric encryption.

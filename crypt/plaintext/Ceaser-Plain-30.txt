The scheme of encryption with public key is directed toward providing confidentiality of message. This scheme ensures that only the intended recipient should be able to decrypt the original ciphertext as sent by sender because only the intended recipient is in possession of the required private key. No other person should be able to decrypt the message. Whether in fact confidentiality is provided or not depends on a number of factors which includes the following. It could be security of the algorithm or whether the private key is kept secure and the security of any protocol of which the encryption function is a part.

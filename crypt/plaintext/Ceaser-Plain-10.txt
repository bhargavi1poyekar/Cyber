It seems possible to perform message authentication simply by the use of symmetric encryption mechanism. If we assume that only the sender and receiver share a key exclusively then only the genuine sender would be able to encrypt a message successfully for the other participant provided the receiver can recognize a valid message. Furthermore if the message includes an error detection code and a sequence number the receiver is assured that no alterations have been made and that sequencing is not tempered with i.e. reordered. If the message also includes a timestamp the receiver is assured that the message has not been delayed.

Digital Signature process works on the following lines. When Alice receives the message plus signature she  calculates a hash value for the message. She provides the hash value and Bobs public key as inputs to a digital signature verification algorithm. If the algorithm returns the result that the signature is valid Alice is assured that the message must have been signed by Bob. No one else has Bobs private key and therefore no one else could have created a signature that could be verified for this message with Bobs public key. In addition it is impossible to alter the message without access to Bobs private key.

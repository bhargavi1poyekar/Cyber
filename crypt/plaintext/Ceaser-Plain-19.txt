Hash Function Requirements. The fifth requirement guarantees that it is impossible to find an alternative message with the same hash value as a given message. This prevents forgery when an encrypted hash code is used. If this property were not true an attacker would be capable forging a message using the following sequence. First observe or intercept a message plus its encrypted hash code. Second generate an unencrypted hash code from the message. Third generate an alternate message with the same hash code. Thus receiver would not know that incoming data or message has been compromised.

Three DES has two attractions that assure its widespread use over the next few years. First with its One Sixty Eight bit key length. it overcomes the vulnerability to brute force attack of Data Encryption Standard. Second the underlying encryption algorithm in  Three DES is the same as in DES. This algorithm has been subjected to more scrutiny than any other encryption algorithm over a longer period of time and no effective cryptanalytic attack based on the algorithm rather than brute force has been found. Accordingly there is a high level of confidence that Three DES is very resistant to cryptanalysis.

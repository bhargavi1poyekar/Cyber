Elliptic Curve Cryptography. The vast majority of the products and standards that use public key cryptography for encryption and digital signatures use RSA. The bit length for secure RSA use has increased over recent years and this has put a heavier processing load on applications. This has ramifications  for ecommerce sites that conduct large numbers of secure transactions. Recently, a competing system has begun to challenge RSA known as elliptic curve cryptography or ECC. Already ECC is showing up in standardization efforts including the IEEE Standard for Public-Key Cryptography.

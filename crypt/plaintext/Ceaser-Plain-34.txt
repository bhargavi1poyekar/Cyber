Diffie Hellman Key Agreement algorithm. The first published public key algorithm appeared in the seminal paper by Diffie and Hellman that defined public key cryptography  and is generally referred to as Diffie Hellman key exchange or key agreement. A number of commercial products employ this key exchange technique. The purpose of the algorithm is to enable two users to securely reach agreement about a shared secret that can be used as a secret key for subsequent symmetric encryption of messages. The algorithm itself is limited to the exchange of the keys. The algorithm in its simplistic terms is subject to MITM attack.

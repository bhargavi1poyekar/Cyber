A public key certificate consists of a public key plus a user identity of the key owner with the whole block signed by a trusted third party. The certificate also includes some information about the third party plus an indication of the period of validity of the certificate. Typically the third party is a certificate authority that is trusted by the user community such as a government agency. A user can present his or her public key to the authority in a secure manner and obtain a signed certificate. The user can then publish the certificate. Anyone needing this users public key can obtain the certificate and verify its validity.

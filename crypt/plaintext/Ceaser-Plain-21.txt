In recent years, the most widely used hash function has been the Secure Hash Algorithm. SHA was developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology  and published as a federal information processing standard FIPS Nineteen Ninety Three. When weaknesses were discovered in SHA, a revised version was issued in Nineteen Ninety Five and is generally referred to as SHA one. SHA one produces a hash value of One Sixty bits. In Two Thousand Two NIST produced a revised version of the standard FIPS two.  It defined three new versions of SHA with hash value lengths of Two Fifty Six or Three Eighty Four or Five hundred twelve bits.

Typically symmetric encryption is applied to a unit of data which is larger than a single Sixty Four bits or One Twenty Eight bits block. Email messages or network packets or database records or any other plaintext sources must be broken up into a series of fixed size length block for encryption by a symmetric block cipher. Each such block of data is encrypted separately. The simplest approach to multiple block encryption is known as electronic codebook ECB mode. In this mode plaintext is handled b bits at a time and each block of plaintext is encrypted using the same key. A plain text of length nb is divided into n b bit blocks.

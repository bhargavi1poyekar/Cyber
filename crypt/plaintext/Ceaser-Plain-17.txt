Generally entire message is not encrypted. Encryption software is quite slow. Even though the amount of data to be encrypted per message is small there may be a steady stream of messages into and out of a system. Encryption hardware costs are nonnegligible. Low cost chip implementations of DES and AES are available but the cost adds up if all nodes in a network must have this capability. Encryption hardware is optimized toward large data sizes. For small blocks of data a high proportion of the time is spent in initialization invocation overhead. An encryption algorithm may be protected by a patent.

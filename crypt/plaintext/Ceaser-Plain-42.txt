A fundamental requirement for two parties to communicate securely is that they share a secret key. Suppose Bob wants to create an application that will enable him to exchange email securely with anyone who has access to the Internet. Suppose Bob wants to do this using symmetric encryption. With symmetric encryption Bob and his correspondent say Alice must come up with a way to share a unique secret key that no one else knows. If Alice is in the next room from Bob Bob could generate a key and write it down on a piece of paper or store it on a disk or thumb drive and hand it to Alice. But the real world is different.

It is now routine for businesses to provide a variety of protections including encryption for information that is transmitted across networks via the Internet or via wireless devices.  Once data are stored locally which is referred to as data at rest then there is often little protection beyond domain authentication and operating system access controls. Data at rest are often routinely backed up to secondary storage such as optical media tape or removable disk archived for indefinite periods. Further even when data are erased from a hard disk until the relevant disk sectors are reused the data are recoverable.

Concerns about the strength of Data Encryption Standard DES fall into two categories.  First one is concern about the algorithm itself and second one is the concern about the use of a Fifty Six bit key. The first concern refers to the possibility that cryptanalysis is possible by exploiting the characteristics of the DES algorithm. Are there any inherent weaknesses in it. Over the years there have been a number of attempts to find and exploit weaknesses in the algorithm. This makes DES the most studied encryption algorithm in existence. Despite numerous approaches no one has so far reported a fatal weakness in DES.

There are several common misconceptions concerning public key encryption. One is that it is more secure from cryptanalysis than symmetric encryption. In fact the security of any encryption scheme depends on two things. First the length of the key and second the computational work involved in breaking a cipher. There is nothing in principle about either symmetric or public key encryption that makes one superior to another from the point of view of resisting cryptanalysis. A second misconception is that public key encryption is a general purpose technique that has made symmetric encryption obsolete.

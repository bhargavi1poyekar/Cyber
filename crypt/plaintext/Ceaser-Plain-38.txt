Digital Signature process works on the following lines. Suppose Bob wants to send a message to Alice. Although it is not important that the message be kept secret Bob wants Alice to be certain that the message is indeed from him. For this purpose Bob uses a secure hash function, such as SHA five one two to generate a hash value for the message. That hash value together with  private key of Bob serve as input to a digital signature generation algorithm that produces a short block that functions as a digital signature. Bob sends the message with the signature attached to Alice. Alice will verify the message using digital signature.

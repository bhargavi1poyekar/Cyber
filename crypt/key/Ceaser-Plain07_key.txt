Plaintext: A typical stream cipher method encrypts the plaintext one byte at a time although a stream cipher may be designed to operate on one bit at a time or on units larger than a byte at a time. Figure Two.Two b is a representative diagram of stream cipher structure. In this structure a key is input to a pseudorandom bit generator that produces a stream of eight bit numbers that are apparently random. A pseudorandom stream is one that is unpredictable without knowledge of the input key and which has an apparently random character. The output of the generator is combined one byte at a time with the plaintext stream.

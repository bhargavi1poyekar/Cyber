Plaintext: Another possible scenario is an exchange in which one side has a heavy load and cannot afford the time to decrypt all incoming messages. Authentication is carried out on a selective basis with messages being chosen at random for checking. Authentication of a computer program in plaintext is an attractive service. The computer program can be executed without having to decrypt it every time which would be wasteful of processor resources. Howeve, if a message authentication tag were attached to the program it could be checked whenever assurance is required of the integrity of the program.

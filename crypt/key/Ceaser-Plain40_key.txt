Plaintext: Public key certificates. If there is some broadly accepted public key algorithm then any participant can send his or her public key to any other participant or broadcast the key to the community at large. Although this approach is convenient it has a major weakness. Anyone can forge such a public announcement. That is some user could pretend to be Bob and send a public key to another participant or broadcast such a public key. Until such time as Bob discovers the forgery and alerts other participants the forger is able to read all encrypted messages intended for Bob and can use the forged keys for authentication.

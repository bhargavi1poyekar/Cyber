Plaintext: RSA algorithm. One of the first public key schemes was developed in the year One Thousand Nine Hundred and Seventy Seven by three inventor Ron Rivest Adi Shamir and Len Adleman at MIT. It was first published one year later. The RSA scheme has since reigned supreme as the most widely accepted and implemented approach to public key encryption. RSA algorithm is a block cipher in which the plaintext and ciphertext are considered as integers between zero and n minus one for some n. They offered a reward of hundred dollars for the return of a plaintext sentence an event they predicted might not occur for some forty quadrillion years.

The universal technique for providing confidentiality for transmitted or stored data is symmetric encryption. This section introduces the basic concept of symmetric encryption. This is followed by an overview of the two most important symmetric encryption algorithms the Data Encryption Standard DES and the Advanced Encryption Standard AES which are block encryption algorithms. Finally this section introduces the concept of symmetric stream encryption algorithms. Symmetric encryption was the only type of encryption in use prior to the introduction of public-key encryption.

We need a strong encryption algorithm. At a minimum we would like the algorithm to be such that an opponent who knows the algorithm and has access to one or more ciphertexts would be unable to decipher the ciphertext or figure out the key. This requirement is usually stated in a stronger form: The opponent should be unable to decrypt ciphertext or discover the key even if he or she is in possession of a number of ciphertexts together with the plaintext that produced each ciphertext. The sender and receiver must have obtained copies of the secret key in a secure fashion and must keep the key secure.",,"130.85.121.26,130.85.121.27"
